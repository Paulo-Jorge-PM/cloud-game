Earlier prototype of this research project: https://github.com/Paulo-Jorge-PM/grammar-patterns

Alternative version, more game oriented.

To run execute the file "main.py", and you need to have Python 2.7 installed and a version of Pyglet (just do "pip install pyglet" in the command line to get it; note: this project is old and the world moved on to Python 3: currently Python 2 pip repo is discontinued, so installing it may not work, for that reason a pyglet directory lib is included; alternatively converting the code to v.3 would also be simple).
