# Cloud Rain #

This is the early stages of a software I made for a research group on psychology,that was studying grammar patterns learning in children. Later it was used to collect data and test children learning skills. But this version is only the early version, a skeleton for the animation and input: with the mouse you control a cloud, if you clikc with left button it rains and the cloud changes to an happy face. in the background tehre is a simple paralax animation of clouds.

This is simple stuff, only made for concept proof. I don't care about licenses, anyone can use this I don't care, I am happy if anything I make in this life is usefull for someone somewhere.

To run execute the file "main.py", and you need to have Python 2.7 installed and a version of Pyglet (just do "pip install pyglet" in the command line to get it).
